      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight">Dark Knight</a>
        is probably my favorite movie of all-time. Even though it just be
        another Batman film, let me list out a few reason why I enjoy this movie
        so much:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Acting (especially by Christian Bale and Heath Ledger)</li>
        <li>
          The dark vibes and tone the movie gave out just make me feel some type
          of way that other movies haven't been able to accomplish
        </li>
        <li>Let's not forget about the opening bank robbery scene</li>
        <li>All of the Joker's scenes were just simply amazing</li>
        <li>Overall, the storytelling and acting is so enjoyable to watch</li>
      </ul>
