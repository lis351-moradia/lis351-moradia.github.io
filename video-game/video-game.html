        The
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us">Last of Us</a>
        is my favorite single-player video game of all time. Even though it may
        just be video game on the outside, it is, in all honesty, a storytelling
        masterpieces that even some modern day films or TV shows can't even
        compare to.

        It is a story when you play as a character Joel, a smuggler tasked with
        escorting a teenage girl, Ellie, across a post-apocalyptic United
        States.

        While from the description, it doesn't seem all that interesting, you
        get to fight off zombies referred to as infected as well as getting to
        witness the stuggles humans have with each other in such times. You also
        get to enjoy the bond the two protagonists, Joel and Ellie, form as they
        try to survive and protect each other throught the many hardships that
        they face
